## Architecture Guardrails

- Before backend architecture, layering, or cross-layer changes, read the ADRs under `apps/backend/docs/adr/`.
- Keep clean-architecture boundaries:
- `domain` must not depend on anything else, such as `infrastructure`, `presentation`, `application`.
- `application` depends on domain contracts/ports, not framework details.
- `presentation` maps HTTP <-> application DTOs/services.
- `infrastructure` implements ports (DB, hashing, etc.).

## Test Suite Placement

- Use `*.test.ts` for fast backend tests run by `npx nx run backend:test`, such as domain entities, application services with test doubles, mappers, validators, and controller logic with mocked dependencies.
- Use `*.integration.test.ts` for slower backend tests run by `npx nx run backend:test:integration`, such as persistence adapters, real database behavior, middleware wired to framework objects, or multiple clean-architecture layers wired together locally.
- Use `*.e2e.test.ts` for end-to-end backend tests run by `npx nx run backend:test:e2e`, such as full HTTP flows through the app boundary.
- Keep test helpers and factories under `apps/backend/test/`, with integration-only helpers under `apps/backend/test/integration/` and e2e-only helpers under `apps/backend/test/e2e/` when the distinction matters.
